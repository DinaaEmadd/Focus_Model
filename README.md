# ðŸŽ¯ Focus Detection System using MediaPipe & OpenCV

This project is a **computer vision pipeline** for analyzing **human focus and attention** from videos.  
It leverages **MediaPipe Face Mesh**, **Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR)**, **Head Pose Estimation**, and **Gaze Tracking** to determine whether a person is focused or distracted while watching/working.

The system can be applied in:
- ðŸ“š **E-learning platforms** â†’ monitor students' attention  
- ðŸš— **Driver monitoring systems** â†’ detect drowsiness and distraction  
- ðŸ’» **Productivity tools** â†’ measure focus during work
